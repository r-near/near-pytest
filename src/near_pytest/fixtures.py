"""
Modular fixtures for near-pytest.

This module provides a pytest-native approach to NEAR smart contracts testing that
focuses on:
1. Simple, composable fixtures that follow pytest conventions
2. Method chaining for contract calls to improve test readability
3. Ergonomic functions with intuitive names
4. Clear separation of concerns with stateless functions

Getting started:
```python
# Import the fixtures you need
from near_pytest.fixtures import sandbox, localnet_alice_account

# Use the fixtures in your tests
def test_my_contract(sandbox, localnet_alice_account):
    # Your test code here
    pass
```
